Codility Solutions
==================

This repository is dedicated to solutions to the Codility lessons.

There's a separate class for every problem (named by the problem itself), each containing a "solution" method, so you can either clone everything or ctrl+f the specific problem you're looking for.

The solutions score 100% for performance and correctness on Codility.

In the future, I may provide multiple solutions for some of the problems, refactor, and add comments for some of them.
